# FlavorNest

FlavorNest is an adorable, cartoon-inspired recipe blog built for the Frontend UI Hackathon 2025. It features a whimsical, storybook aesthetic with vibrant colors, animated food characters, and a unique Cooking Mode guided by a cartoon chef. Built with React (Vite), plain CSS, and JavaScript, it uses localStorage for mock data persistence and is deployed on Vercel.

## Features
- **Recipe Grid**: Displays 4-5 recipe cards with wobbling animations on hover.
- **Recipe Details**: Shows ingredients with checkboxes, instructions, and a "Save Recipe" button with toast notifications.
- **Search and Filter**: Filters recipes by name or category with bounce animations.
- **Cooking Mode**: Enlarges text, locks scrolling, and features a dancing chef with speech bubbles.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile (320px+) and desktop (1024px+).
- **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and high contrast ratios.
